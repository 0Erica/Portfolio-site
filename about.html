      <h4>The Creative</h4>
      <p>As an accomplished designer I take pride and confidence in all my work. I have worked very diligently to achieve where I am today and I will continue to work and improve my skills to become the best version of me. As a result I am a quick learner with strong determination and resilience.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I have always admired the effort and precision applied to design and illustrations. I knew following a career such as Graphic Design would be a hard and competitive road but itâ€™s a part of me that I cannot deviate from. I graduated from Illinois State University in the distinguished BFA program in Graphic Design. I have advanced experience in the Adobe suite, specifically Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, After Effects, Premiere, and Audition. But I am also an aspiring digital illustrator. I have a strong passion and eye for design, illustration and animation. I continue to reach for my dreams and honing my skill to become successful in the career of my passion.</p>
